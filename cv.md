Sattar Vakili is Principal AI Research Manager at MediaTek Research, the research arm of MediaTek — a globally leading semiconductor company. His research focuses on sequential decision-making under uncertainty, with expertise in optimization, bandits and reinforcement learning, kernel-based modelling, and neural networks.

Before joining MediaTek, Sattar worked at Secondmind, a Cambridge-based research lab directed by Professor Carl Rasmussen, where he developed methods for kernel and Gaussian process models. Earlier, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University. He received his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering (minor in Applied Mathematics) from Cornell University in 2017, under the supervision of Professor Qing Zhao, with a dissertation on sequential methods for learning and optimization.
